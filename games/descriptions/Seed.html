	<em>Cloud seeding</em> is mankind’s attempt to change how much – or what kind – of precipitation falls from the clouds. By introducing a chemical “seed,” molecules of water come together to form drops of water, flakes of snow, or pellets of hail. You are that seed. By gathering molecules of water to form drops and gathering drops to form snowflakes or hail, you control what will rain down on humanity. Taking control of what substances you collect as you fall from the sky gives you the <em>power</em> to give life, the <em>ability</em> to destroy, and the <em>chance</em> to make life beautiful. There is no way for you to see where you’re falling, who you are going to save or destroy, or what you can do to make life better. You simply have to try. After all, what more does a drop of water know than to fall from the sky?

	Players begin by controlling a seed molecule that collects molecules of water (or pollutants) while falling through the sky. By pushing the seed molecule left and right using swiping gestures, players gather enough water to condense into droplets, and then gather enough droplets to condense into rain, sleet, hail, or snow, depending on given weather conditions. Weather conditions for each round will be randomly generated each time the player begins. The player might be given conditions sufficient to rain gently on a drought-ridden village, hail fiercely and obliterate a fully-developed cityscape, or cause a blizzard to wreak havoc on rural farmland. Collecting pollutants will poison or destroy a landscape, while keeping the water pure might replenish the water supply of a dying ecosystem. Each round will last about 90 seconds, giving the player ample time to collect, condense, and crystallize.
