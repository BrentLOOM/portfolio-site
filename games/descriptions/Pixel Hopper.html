	<em>Pixel Hopper</em> is an early game development venture, mimicking the core gameplay of Lima Sky's <a href="http://doodlejump.org/" target="_blank" title="DoodleJump.org">Doodle Jump (2009)</a>. Developed in <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank" title="Processing.org">Processing</a>, a Java-based open-source programming language for art and visual media creation, <em>Pixel Hopper</em> takes the concept behind Doodle Jump and brings it into the realm of 16-bit retro arcade-style platformers. The entirety of <em>Pixel Hopper</em> was written in Processing without the use of any third-party plug-ins.
