	In the early 17th century, the mysterious and vast Pacific Ocean has been a key travel route for sailors and pirates alike. A Malaysian pirate fleet, the Black Powder Bandits, has decided to embark on a journey to claim their rightful spoils of the Pacific Gold Rush. The pirate fleet begins at the pier of the Strait of Malacca. Their Captain was pleased to announce the terminus of their adventure would be the exotic New World - the United States. Burdened by the pressure of limited time and an exhausting food supply, the Bandits need to trek across half the globe, making their way through eight exotic countries. Avoiding boulders and cannon fire is just the beginning; can the Bandits get the gold before their time runs out?
