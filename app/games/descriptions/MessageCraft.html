	Twitter and Facebook are secretly interactive storytelling media: within each medium, millions of individuals engage in a “cyclic process between two or more active agents [themselves and their friends/followers]  in which each agent alternately listens, thinks, and speaks,” a definition Chris Crawford uses to encapsulate interactivity in media (28).  Social media are interactive systems in which one expresses their views, and thinks about and reacts to the views of others, leading to changes in or reinforcements of one’s own views and the views of others. While there is no “winning” Twitter or Facebook, there is a benchmark for success: the proliferation of followers, attention, and exposure. Given the nature of recent media phenomena involving the correlation between mainstream media, social media, and presidential election predictions, a systematic link between an individual’s social media presence, their rhetoric, and their exposure to the masses can be inferred.

	Using this link as a framework, <em>MessageCraft</em> mimics the essence of these social media platforms. In <em>MessageCraft</em>, players inhabit the role of an important social media icon–one with tens of thousands of followers, including mainstream media accounts and competitors. As is typically the case with their real-world counterparts, players of the game react to various socio-political or economic events, posting about their specific views on the matter. However, rather than allowing for free-writing, <em>MessageCraft</em> has its players complete a “mad lib”-like statement with a series of blanks. Each blank can be populated with various words, each of which has its own values associated with it. Each choice of word, in turn, changes the meaning of the message to be posted. The culmination of the message’s values change how a player’s followers, members of the mainstream media, and competitors respond. Thus, according to Crawford, each choice is “functionally significant,” in that it “satisfies [players’] desires, needs, and interests” by offering them meaningful and consequential choices (41).

	The crux of play in <em>MessageCraft</em>, however, is the result of these interactions: the procurement of free media. In the game, media exposure as a result of a player’s posts is measured in U.S. dollars. The player’s goal, then, is to craft messages in such a way that this media exposure is maximized each time a post is made. A “successful” post will garner significant attention (in the form of replies, mentions, and reposts), increasing followers and media exposure. An “unsuccessful” post will result in loss of followers and/or little to no media exposure. However, the definition of a “successful” post may not be so obvious: after all, there is (clearly) no such thing as bad publicity.
